= Version

The source code of marxup.py claims it's v1x, implementation a.

= Implementations

The fragmentation of marxup is worse than Android! There are at least four
parallel implementations of marxup. They're not identical, but all are v1.

Python's regexp is better than Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9 is better than both and we
don't know about Io. Lua is good at generating HTML.

* Io (used in poncho)
** Slowest because Io is slow
* Ruby (used in marx)
** Fast because ruby is "fast"
** Slightly different syntax
** Maybe a kind of version 1.5 (but source says 0.6.5)
* Python (this one, used in pyncho)
** Equivalent to the Ruby version??
* Lua (used in Sdf)
** Officially this is "NovaML" and not marxup
* C (used in blog.c)
** Supports comments and magic
