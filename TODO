= marxup 2 (egelsdown)

marxup 2: egelsdown got a specification in an IRC meeting February 2, 2009:

* Support for plugins ("marxists")
* Merge all implementations
* More special effects
* Change the entire parser to be line or paragraph based

= neomarxup

We'll skip marxup 2 and go straight to the markup language of the future:
neomarxup.
