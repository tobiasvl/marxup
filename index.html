A spectre is haunting Europe -- the spectre of communism. All the powers of old
Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope and
Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.

= Marxup

Marxup, the happy pha markup language, is used in several projects in different
languages. This is the Python implementation. All the implementations are
slightly different. Marxup is more fragmented than Android.

* http://blekksprut.net/git/marxup/

= Version

The source code of marxup.py claims it's v1x, implementation a.

= Implementations

The fragmentation of marxup is worse than Android! There are at least four
parallel implementations of marxup. They're not identical, but all are v1.

Python's regexp is better than Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9 is better than both and we
don't know about Io. Lua is good at generating HTML.

* Io (used in poncho)
** Slowest because Io is slow
* Ruby (used in marx)
** Fast because ruby is "fast"
** Slightly different syntax
** Maybe a kind of version 1.5 (but source says 0.6.5)
* Python (this one, used in pyncho)
** Equivalent to the Ruby version??
* Lua (used in Sdf)
** Officially this is "NovaML" and not marxup
* C (used in blog.c)
** Supports comments and magic

= marxup 2 (egelsdown)

marxup 2: egelsdown got a specification in an IRC meeting February 2, 2009:

* Support for plugins ("marxists")
* Merge all implementations
* More special effects
* Change the entire parser to be line or paragraph based

= neomarxup

We'll skip marxup 2 and go straight to the markup language of the future:
neomarxup.

= pyncho

This marxup implementation is used in pyncho:
